Today, FOREIGNER, the band behind these iconic songs announced the launch of their Farewell Tour.<br></p><p>The tour is set to launch on July 6, 2023, at Atlanta’s Ameris Bank Amphitheatre, the area’s largest outdoor venue. For the first leg of the US Live Nation tour, FOREIGNER will be joined by LOVERBOY, one of the 80’s biggest hit-makers. The spectacular show will thrill audiences with stellar performances of more than 20 combined chart-topping songs. Tickets go on sale on November 18, 2022 at <a href=#>LiveNation.com</a>. The full routing can be found below.&nbsp;<br></p><p>FOREIGNER will continue its long-term initiative with the GRAMMY Museum Foundation&nbsp;to invite choirs to open the show with a live a cappella ‘Pitch Perfect’ performance of Classic Rock songs. FOREIGNER will join radio partners across the country to create a contest for local choirs to win donations to their music programs. One winning choir will be selected at each show, and that choir will receive a grand prize of new musical equipment.&nbsp; For more details please go to&nbsp;<a href=#>foreignerchoirs.com</a>.<br></p><p>Leader and founder of FOREIGNER, Mick Jones said, “Many years ago, I wrote a song called ‘Feels Like The First Time’ and today we are launching one last worldwide tour.&nbsp; We will be presenting a show that I know will have the same enthusiasm as our very first appearances.&nbsp; The tour will start this summer in America and we hope to get to every place that we have played over the last several years.&nbsp; While I’m sure our fans will have mixed feelings about the end of the road for the band, I know our shows are going to delight audiences everywhere.”<br></p><p>Says FOREIGNER lead singer Kelly Hansen, “The time has come. We have more or less lived our lives on the road for almost eighteen years.&nbsp; We have always strived to give you our best and we intend to finish this the same way. Foreigner has a brilliant and increasingly demanding catalogue of songs to sing and I refuse to give them less than they deserve. So, we’re going to finish strong. I want to make it very clear how grateful and appreciative we are to our audiences all over the world who have supported this band.&nbsp; I’m sure there may be occasions when we’ll do some special appearances, but I think the time is coming for us to live off the road. Thank you all so much!”<br></p><p>“I remember how cool the last time we toured with Foreigner was in 1982.&nbsp; We played to massive stadiums – New Orleans, Kansas City, Day On the Green in Oakland, JFK in Philly – and we’re back together again, 41 years later.&nbsp; It’s going to be the Tour of Summer ’23!” said Paul Dean of Loverboy.<br></p><p>“It’s not very often you get a chance to play on the same stage as one of your all-time favorite bands…and how many hit songs can you play on the same stage every night of a 2023 Summer tour?….. it’s going to be amazing…. I can’t wait.” Said Mike Reno of Loverboy.</p><p>Mick Jones continues to elevate&nbsp;FOREIGNER’s influence and guide the band to new horizons with&nbsp;his stylistic songwriting, indelible guitar hooks and multi-layered talents while lead singer Kelly Hansen, one of&nbsp;rock’s greatest showmen, has led FOREIGNER into the digital age inspiring a whole new generation of fans.
