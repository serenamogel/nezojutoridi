Of course! So, I decided to meet him for the photo session at the gym in the Grosvenor House Hotel,” she recalled to The Post in 2018. “Christopher made it very clear that the gym was the number one issue for his preparation in the role of Superman. He would go through his strict workout regime for me to photograph. This consisted of weightlifting, punch bag, skipping rope and so on.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve at age 24, weightlifting. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Rare new photos of Christopher Reeve training. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><p>She added: “He seemed to enjoy being photographed and showing off how his body had taken on that triangular Superman shape.”</p><p>Unlike today’s bulky Marvel superheroes such as Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans, Reeve had a tall and lean physique in these weightlifting photos.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a 1998 interview with <a href=#>Ability Magazine</a>, Reeve&nbsp;increased his weight by 30 pounds and added four inches to his chest and three inches to his biceps during his training for “Superman.” He also increased his bench press from 100 pounds to 350.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve gained 30 pounds of muscle to play Superman. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve weight training in new photos. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><p>Reeve’s first trainer was David Prowse, who played the role of Darth Vader for the entirety of the original “Star Wars” trilogy.</p><p>A 1978 “behind the scenes” <a href=#>video feature </a>said that at first, “Superman producers” considered him “too young, and maybe even too skinny” for the role.</p><p>Before landing on the then-unknown Reeve, producers<a href=#> reportedly considered</a> bigger stars for the lead, including Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Sylvester Stallone and Caitlyn Jenner (who was then Bruce).</p><p>He can also be seen in London, promoting the seminal 1978 film.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve in London, promoting “Superman.” <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve in London in 1978. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve during his 1978 trip to London. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><p>In a 1981 interview on CNN, Reeve told an anecdote about Margot Kidder, who played Lois Lane, getting him to come to her 3-year-old child’s birthday party.</p><p>“All the kids were promised that Superman was going to show up,” he said. “So I come in, wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans.

The key is what do you do afterwards. There is a period of shock and then grieving with confusion and loss. After that, you have two choices. One is to stare out the window and gradually disintegrate. And the other is to mobilize and use all your resources, whatever they may be, to do something positive. That is the road I have taken. It comes naturally to me. I am a competitive person and right now I am competing against decay. I don’t want osteoporosis or muscle atrophy or depression to beat me.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve in London, promoting “Superman.” <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Christopher Reeve in his best Clark Kent look, in 1978. <span class=credit>Eva Sereny / Iconic Images</span></figure><p>Following that tragedy, he became a spokesperson for people with similar disabilities and lobbied for spinal injury research, believing there could be a cure.</p><p>“There are some people who have been in [wheel] chairs for a very long time who say, ‘there is nothing wrong with me,'” he <a href=#>told Ability Magazine</a> in 1998. “They don’t believe that a cure is possible and that it is a waste of time or maybe they are just in a mindset where they think research is irrelevant. So, it is very hard to represent the entire disability community. I am doing what I can, based on my own beliefs. I think that is all an individual can do. I am trying to share the effort on behalf of others.
