He just needed a play-by-play announcer to pair with John, and “there weren’t any young up-and-comers” from which to choose.</p><p>So he tapped Cris, who was then working in Football Night in America, to “begin a crash course in learning how to be a play-by-play announcer.”</p><p>Even though Cris thought Dick had “lost [his] mind,” he gave the play-by-play role the ol’ college try. He practiced alongside Merril Hoge, and then worked with Madden during a Patriots-Broncos playoff game in January 2006. But in the midst of that game, Dick found out that ABC/ESPN was willing to let Al out of his contract. So Dick snapped up Al, and Cris ended his brief run as play-by-play announcer. And then, in 2009, Cris became Sunday Night Football’s color commentator after John retired.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans seem glad Cris stuck to his color commentator role.</h2><p>After Pro Football Talk reported on that anecdote from Dick’s book, social media users expressed their relief that Cris and John never teamed up as play-by-play announcer as color commentator, respectively.</p><p>“This would’ve been terrible,” one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p>“Dodged a bullet there,” another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>And a third person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “What a horror show that would have been.”</p><p>Yes, the shade is real when it comes to Sunday Night Football fans, although one Twitter user at least <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave Cris faint praise</a>: “I honestly think Cris is a pretty good second voice, but he would have been a disaster as a play-by-play.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScqpmoeqS7y6Wgp6unpL%2B1tA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-most-expensive-hotels-in-nigeria-location-address.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Most Expensive Hotels in Nigeria/Location, Address</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blackberry-playbook-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The BlackBerry PlayBook Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
