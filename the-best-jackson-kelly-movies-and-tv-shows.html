Since his momentous decision, he’s worked with stalwarts like Bob Odenkirk, and had a few small but well regarded parts in some shows, as well as a some more involved roles that have put him right on Hollywood’s radar. Although he hasn’t quite exploded like some young talent does, Kelly looks right on track to break into the harsh world of showbiz, with upcoming parts in some major productions – like the adaptation of Bonnie Garmus’ smash hit Lessons in Chemistry.

The Last Thing He Told Me</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=892 data-current-count=1192 data-injectable=true>Though Kelly was only in this dramatic mini-series for a few scenes, he was memorable as a campus tour guide and enough of an on-screen draw to make viewers look twice at him (probably helped by the fact he could lean into a Texan accent, something he’s undoubtedly great at thanks to his upbringing). The series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filmed mostly in Texas</a>, stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Garner</a> as Hannah, a woman who bonds with her previously aloof step-daughter Bailey when her husband and Bailey’s father goes missing. However, she soon discovers that her husband wasn’t really who he said he was, and she and Bailey quickly find themselves at the heart of a dangerous criminal conspiracy that they would have never known existed previously, while Bailey discovers some secrets about her own family history. Not the best show in the world, but if you like these sorts of mysteries, it will scratch an itch.</p><h2 id=h-6-the-thing-about-pam data-injectable=false>6. The Thing About Pam</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=984 data-current-count=1284 data-injectable=true>This fast-paced, true-crime comedy drama miniseries only saw Kelly appear for a short period of time, but he managed to leave an impression on viewers in what was a fun but ultimately forgettable show. The Thing About Pam <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">follows the life of murderer and house flipper Pam Hupp</a> in the days and months after she killed her cancer-stricken friend, Betsy Faria. Pam frames Betsy’s husband Russ for the murder, and ends up receiving a large amount of money from a newly changed life insurance policy that Betsy had taken out. Pam told the police that she was the last person to see her friend alive, before implying the deceased was about to reveal some horrible information about Russ. However, holes soon appear in Pam’s story, all while television producers from NBC’s Dateline try to utilize the sordid crime to boost figures, in the process figuring out that Pam had a much shadier past than anyone could have guessed. Not a must-watch, but not a bad watch, either.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Lucky Hank</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=924 data-current-count=1224 data-injectable=true>This black comedy drama stars the brilliant Bob Odenkirk as a failed novelist and English professor at an underfunded college, and delves into all kinds of intriguing themes and questions, like just what is creativity, and how much of success is down to luck, circumstance, and personality over talent? The plot follows the titular character as he is almost fired from his job for a rant that goes viral, before he eventually retains his position, all while he’s going through a classic midlife crisis. At the same time, the shadow of his overbearing and more successful father haunts him, his wife is aggitating for a move to New York, and his daughter is going through her own marriage problems. Kelly plays a recurring character, a student named Bartow, and offers plenty of great screen presence despite a small part, making him just one of the many facets of this show that ensured it has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been a critical success</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Portrait of a Young Man</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Portrait-of-a-Young-Man.jpg><p data-characters=737 data-current-count=1037 data-injectable=true>Kelly stars in this moving, sensitive independent film about an increasingly urgent topic that doesn’t receive much attention: eating disorders in boys. He plays the part of Grayson Johnson, a young man who is struggling with his identity and how to communicate with his family. This is all exacerbated by the fact his parents are going through marital issues. Soon, Grayson develops an eating disorder, but with the help of his family he is able to battle through and forge his own path in life. The film was inspired by the creator’s real experiences of a near decade-long eating disorder, and was funded through Kickstarter. With some intense and deep themes, it’s not an easy watch, but definitely a rewarding film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. The Good Doctor</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=901 data-current-count=1201 data-injectable=true>Kelly made a brilliant appearance on this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">much-loved medical drama</a>, which in April was renewed for a 7th season. He plays the part of Drew, a young man with recurring tumors caused by something called Gardner Syndrome. Although his quality of life is already hugely impacted, he maintains a sunny veneer, but the doctors are concerned about a benign tumor on his liver that has failed to respond to chemo, and decide to bring Drew into surgery to remove the tumor. He then moves on to the list to get a small bowel transplant. However, the surgery proves to be more challenging than expected thanks to the tumor being much larger than first thought – leading to Drew being bumped up the transplant list. However, the doctors manage to salvage the situation, so it’s a relatively happy ending all around. Kelly is empathetic and believable, adding charm to what could have been a very sad role.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Splinters</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=901 data-current-count=1201 data-injectable=true>Kelly is the star of the show in this deep thinker of a film, which delves into loss and the impact grief can have on those who are left behind. He plays the character of Bo, who’s recently lost his dad and is living with his mom in an isolated spot in the heart of the Midwest. He and his mother have stopped communicating since his father’s passing, and both seem unable to break the barrier that’s formed between them. As Bo pushes his mother away, he eventually goes looking for a hidden treasure that’s supposedly buried at a local sawmill, while his mom begins a friendship (or more) with one of Bo’s teachers. The film is beautifully shot and Kelly is absolutely magnetic in it, displaying emotion with a deftness and profundity that many more experienced actors lack. Proof that he’s got a lot of talent, even if the MCU hasn’t come calling quite yet.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. My Year of Dicks</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=1185 data-current-count=1485 data-injectable=false>This raunchy yet sweet and smart animated short was nominated for an Oscar, and when you sit down to watch it you understand why. Kelly voices the part of Sam, the lead character’s best friend, confidant, and eventual lover. My Year of Dicks follows a familiar coming-of-age storyline, although the animation style, comedy, and all-around heart of the short launches it into true brilliance. In the film, we go back to 1991 and join a Houston teen named Pam, who is attempting to find the right boy to have sex with for the first time so that she can become the woman she always wanted to be. After a series of mishaps, rude awakenings, and plenty of laughs, she’s left thinking that perhaps boys aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, and in the process hurts the feelings of her best friend. However, upon discovering her mother’s old love letters, she realizes that perfection is overrated, and reconciles with Sam, before it’s implied that they end up having sex as he’s “the right man.” Funny, charming, and a great watch, Kelly portrays a lot with just his voice, showing that he’s got plenty going on in terms of talent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMm5ysrF2frqS30qilZqOVobm6ecyoraKdo2Kur7CMra1mq5ikxLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./banana-pancakes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Banana Pancakes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leon-edwards-father-death-and-obituary-his-dad-was-a-sex-trafficker-and-drug-lord.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leon Edwards Father Death And Obituary: His Dad Was A Sex Trafficker And Drug Lord</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
