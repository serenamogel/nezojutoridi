This space-age design was part of the "Modern Americana" dinnerware promotion created by Franciscan, and the pattern includes a variety of fun, irregularly shaped piece types.</span></span><h2>Does Franciscan Starburst have lead?</h2>ALL FRANCISCAN POTTERIES pieces I have EVER TESTED have had a similarly high level of Lead. They also normally leach Lead when tested in a lab.<h2>When was Franciscan dinnerware made?</h2>They were originally produced in Glendale, California by Gladding, McBean & Co. in the year 1934. The company produced casual dinnerware in the style of Mexican folk pottery. It was sold under the name Franciscan and was quite popular even during the Great Depression.<h2>Is Franciscan China valuable?</h2>The value of Franciscan line, Apple pattern dinnerware, made in 1940 to 1953, range from $3 to $110.<h2>Does Franciscan dinnerware contain lead?</h2>Franciscan China is generally (and consistently) VERY high in lead. I highly recommend not having any in your home and not ever using for food use purposes. If you want to keep one piece on hand to remind you of your grandmother (or of a time gone by!)<h2>Pastry Chef Attempts to Make Gourmet Starburst | Gourmet Makes | Bon Appétit</h2><p></p><h2>Who made Franciscan dinnerware?</h2>The trademark name Franciscan Ware was used by the manufacturer Gladding, McBean and Company starting in 1934.

Marks are often referred to as back-stamps or bugs. These are marks used by Gladding, McBean & Co.<h2>Is Franciscan Ware oven safe?</h2>A new round mark featuring the Franciscan arch at its top as well as "Made in California U.S.A. Hand Decorated Gladding, McBean & Co." and OVEN-SAFE was used from 1953 to 1958. OVEN-SAFE is also found on later Franciscan stamps.<h2>How do you know if there is lead in your dishes?</h2>The only way to determine if certain tableware has lead is to test it. Home lead test kits can tell you if the dishes have leachable lead. These tests are most useful in detecting high levels of lead.<h2>Can Franciscan earthenware go in dishwasher?</h2>Microwave and dishwasher safe, this tableware is durable enough to use every day.

The plant in Southern California was closed in 1984, after the Franciscan division was bought over by Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, Ltd., in 1979, and production was moved to the United Kingdom.<h2>Can you eat off vintage plates?</h2>We do not recommend not using old ware unless it shows signs of deterioration such as cracking or pitting of the glaze. This could be a sign that the glaze is disintegrating and could allow lead to leach into food.<h2>When did they stop using lead in china?</h2>If you are using dinnerware manufactured prior to 1971 or manufactured in another country, be sure there are no cracks, chips or damage to the glaze finish where lead can leach out, and look for a label that says it is safe for food use. You also can purchase home lead test kits and test them yourself.<h2>What brands of dinnerware are lead free?</h2><p>Top six safest dinnerware brands to use at home (not made in China)</p><ul><li>Glass Anchor Hocking Lead-free Dishes – Made in USA. ...</li><li>Ceramic Fiestaware Lead-free Dishes – Made in USA. ...</li><li>Glass Libbey Crisa Moderno Lead-free Dinnerware – Made in USA & Mexico. ...</li><li>Porcelain Sur La Table Lead-free Dinnerware Set – Made in Turkey.</li></ul><h2>Do vintage dishes have lead?</h2>Vintage ceramic dishware like clay pots, cups, and plates from overseas may have high levels of lead that can contaminate your food.
