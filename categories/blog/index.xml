Makikisilong lang,
Magpapalipas ng ulan,
Kwentuhan lang ang katapat,
Pero mas masaya kung ilabas ang gitara.Refrain:
Bigyan ng ingay itong gabi,
Walang tahimik na sandali,
Tara na...
Umawit kasabay ng kanta.
Chorus:
Tuma-tambay at nagkakatitigan.
Alam naman nila kahit na di mag aminan.
Tuma-tambay at nagkaka-igihan.
Ito ang ating kwento.
Ituloy mo lang ang kwento at tayo'y gagawa ng kanta.

Hanggang malimot ang ulan.
