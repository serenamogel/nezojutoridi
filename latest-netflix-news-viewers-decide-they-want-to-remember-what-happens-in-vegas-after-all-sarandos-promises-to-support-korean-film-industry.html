A Razzie nominee has made it to the top of the streaming charts, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was pressured into commenting on Netflix’s support of local artists, and more. Let’s dive right on in.</p><h2 id=h-what-happens-in-vegas-tops-the-charts-because-it-s-about-time-people-get-nostalgic-for-2008 data-injectable=false>What Happens in Vegas tops the charts (because it’s about time people get nostalgic for 2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-happens-in-vegas-1.jpg><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>If you told me back in 2008 that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What Happens in Vegas</a> — a fluffy rom-com starring Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz — would be at the top of Netflix’s streaming charts in not just one, but 56 countries worldwide, well, I’d… I’d probably ask what Netflix was. But if I did know what Netflix was, I’d say it’s pretty impressive that a Razzie nominee, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a whopping 25% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, has managed to enthrall audiences after all this time.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Listen, I’m not saying What Happens in Vegas is a masterpiece or anything, but I get it. It’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no secret that I love bad movies</a>, and this movie’s part of what I like to call “FXCore” movies. They’re those films that you stumble across in the middle of an afternoon while you’re scrolling through random channels. It’s Sunday and you have nothing to do, so you can’t help but watch, slack-jawed and barely conscious. If you have a spare hour and a half, there are worse ways to spend your free time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sarandos pledges to support the Korean film industry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Squid-Game.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Netflix’s reputation for supporting local productions isn’t exactly sterling, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nor is its legacy of not paying its creatives</a>. At a summit in Seoul, lawmakers and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korean industry figures pressed Netflix CEO Sarandos to comment</a> on how the streamer will support Korean media, particularly since the service has been making a ton of money off of Korean creatives.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>The South Korean government has previously had to spend $390 million on subsidies to support smaller networks and streaming services that cannot compete with the foreign conglomerate. The debate over Netflix’s poor division of profits is central to several current events, including the Writers’ Strike. Sarandos’ comments were a good start — now let’s just hope that the company puts its money where its mouth is.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mark Millar’s The Chosen One gets a first look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-chosen-one-netflix-1.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>The Chosen One, an adaptation of Mark Millar’s American Jesus, is currently set to premiere on August 16. Ahead of its release, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has opted to release a first look at the project</a>, but many are questioning the success of the project following the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">failure of Millar’s Jupiter’s Legacy</a>. That project is one of the biggest bombs Netflix has ever produced, so it’s fair to be a little skeptical.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>I mean, it’s Mark Millar. How controversial can he be? Don’t answer that. Still, the production is its own project. I’m sure it won’t necessarily follow the same path as Jupiter’s Legacy. I mean, IT doesn’t have the same reputation as The Langoliers.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tenoch Huerta drops out of Fiesta en la Madriguera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/namor-black-panther-wakanda-forever-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Fiesta en la Madriguera was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced just last month</a>.

Following the success of the first Extraction, the second film hits audiences with even bigger and better action sequences (and more Chris Hemsworth than you can handle).
