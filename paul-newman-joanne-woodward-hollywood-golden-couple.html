"I was shy, a bit conservative. It took me a long time to persuade her that I wasn't as dull as I looked."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Indeed, any suspicion over Newman's picture-perfect looks and alleged dullness soon gave way to a mutual appreciation and affection, paving the way for a union that would serve as the gold standard for all couples who weather life's unpredictable twists and bumps together.</p><img alt='Members of the cast of the hit Broadway show "The Desperate Hours" enjoy an outing to Rockaway&#39;s Playland.

He fathered a daughter shortly after "Picnic" opened on Broadway in February 1953, and another girl arrived the following year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Newman and Woodward tried to keep their relationship professional. He even set her up with a friend, playwright James Costigan, describing her as "a wonderful girl." Yet the young, attractive thespians couldn't keep apart for long, particularly as their burgeoning careers kept them in the same social and professional orbit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fresh off the success of his first hit film Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), Newman revealed to his wife, Jackie, that he was in love with Woodward. He soon moved out of their Long Island home, though she refused to end the marriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time Newman and Woodward were tapped to co-star in The Long, Hot Summer (1958), they no longer bothered concealing their romance from the cast, crew or any other casual observer. Jackie finally agreed to a divorce, clearing the path for the co-stars to tie the knot in Las Vegas in January 1958.</p><img alt="View of married American actors Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) and Joanne Woodward, the former of whom photographs the latter, in their Greenwich Village apartment, New York, New York, circa 1961." title="View of married American actors Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) and Joanne Woodward, the former of whom photographs the latter, in their Greenwich Village apartment, New York, New York, circa 1961." width=4751 height=3680 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1311322525.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Newman photographing his wife Joanne Woodward in their Greenwich Village apartment, New York City, circa 1961.; Getty Images / Photo Researchers / Contributor</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Woodward struggled juggling motherhood and her career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Newman felt guilty about the divorce, he and Woodward could finally cast aside the burden of carrying on an illicit relationship. They soon settled into the next phase of their life as Hollywood's golden couple.</p><img alt='Paul Newman Family during "2001: A Space Odyssey" New York City Screening - April 3, 1968 at Loews Capitol Theatre in New York City, New York, United States.' title='Paul Newman Family during "2001: A Space Odyssey" New York City Screening - April 3, 1968 at Loews Capitol Theatre in New York City, New York, United States.' width=2490 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-105540779.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">&lt;em>Woodward and Newman with their daughters during the &lt;/em>2001: A Space Odysseyundefined&lt;em>screening in New York City on April 3, 1968.&lt;/em>; Getty Images / Ron Galella / Contributor</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During this time, Newman made the leap from heartthrob actor to big-time movie star with films including The Hustler (1961) and Hud (1963). Woodward, meanwhile, appeared content to slow her career and raise their growing family; Just one year after winning an Academy Award for her performance in The Three Faces of Eve (1957), she gave birth to the first of their three daughters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the transition from Oscar recipient to motherhood wasn't easy for Woodward, who later admitted she was never particularly comfortable with children. She still harbored ambitions to make her mark on stage and screen; Levy writes in A Life that she once dug into her husband for being "selfish" after he declined to co-star in one of her preferred projects, both knowing that his involvement would guarantee the film being made.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Newman eventually reversed course and joined her for what became A New Kind of Love (1963). Five years later, he made her the focus of his big screen directing debut, Rachel, Rachel. Woodward showed she could still pack a wallop as a dramatic actress even as she aged out of the lead romantic roles.</p><img alt="Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman relax on the beach between races in a scene from the film 'Winning,' 1969." title="Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman relax on the beach between races in a scene from the film 'Winning,' 1969." width=5617 height=4464 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-148295965.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman relax on the beach between races in a scene from the film Winning, 1969.; Getty Images / Michael Ochs Archives / Stringer</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Newman and Woodward enjoyed working together while prizing separate interests</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Hollywood's double standard for age and beauty, Newman remained one of the most famous movie stars in the world as he breezed through his 40s while Woodward's trajectory stalled. The seeming mismatch of the still-virile leading man and his critically respected but lesser-known wife sparked inevitable rumors of a marriage on the rocks, prompting the couple to take out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times in 1969 to assert their commitment to one another.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A Life indicates that Newman was having an affair with journalist Nancy Bacon around this time. The couple managed to get through what could have been an irreparable rupture to their union by flying off to England—the site of their honeymoon—for some much-needed one-on-one time.</p><img alt="American actor Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) as racing driver Frank Capua in 'Winning', directed by James Goldstone, 1969." title="American actor Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) as racing driver Frank Capua in 'Winning', directed by James Goldstone, 1969." width=2400 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-166821048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">American actor Paul Newman as racing driver Frank Capua in 'Winning,' directed by James Goldstone, 1969.&amp;nbsp;; Getty Images / Silver Screen Collection / Contributor</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their relationship survived, in part, because each discovered an outside interest that, if not fully understood by the other, at least received spousal endorsement. For Newman, it was a curiosity for auto racing that developed into a full-throttle passion following his turn as a driver in 1969's Winning. For Woodward, it was an appreciation for ballet, both as a means of exercise and a form of artistic expression, that prompted her to become a patron of several troupes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Together, they campaigned for political candidates and remained devoted to their primary jobs, with Newman again stepping behind the camera to direct his wife in The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds (1972). And when it came time to put aside work for the day, the couple retreated to their beloved estate in a wooded section of Westport, Connecticut, which included a treehouse specifically earmarked for their privacy when guests were in town.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Aging brought maturity, but not the dimming of mutual affection</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tragedy struck in 1978 when Newman's son from his first marriage, Scott, died from an accidental drug overdose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The news rocked all members of the extended family and seemingly sparked a shift in the couple's priorities. Together they raised funds for the Scott Newman Foundation, focused on substance abuse education, and Newman built on an impressive philanthropic record by launching his Hole in the Wall Gang Camps for children stricken with debilitating illnesses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The shift also was reflected in their screen roles. Newman was now moving into the "elder statesman" phase of his career, finally nabbing an Oscar for The Color of Money (1986), while Woodward picked up an Emmy for playing an Alzheimer's patient in the TV film Do You Remember Love? (1985). They also resumed their longtime collaboration with the Newman-directed, Woodward-headlined The Glass Menagerie (1987) and went on to co-star in Mr. and Mrs. Bridge (1990).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the serious nature of their performances, the two maintained a playful appreciation of one another in public. Newman, who once famously declared his monogamy by telling Playboy, "I have steak at home; why go out for hamburger?," again risked his wife's wrath by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/magazine/testing-himself.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="comparing her to a bottle of fine wine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">comparing her to a bottle of fine wine</a> in a New York Times interview. Later, when Woodward visited him on the set of the 1998 film Twilight, a mischievous Newman pulled a young Liev Schreiber aside to comment on her sexiness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sound bites aside, there were times when Newman simply needed to be in his life companion's presence. While filming Blaze (1989) in Louisiana, he abruptly called Woodward and asked her to join him. Although she was in the midst of the spring semester at New York's Sarah Lawrence College, with the hope of completing a long-delayed degree, she dropped everything to head south. "There's no academic degree in the world that can compare in importance to the fact that the person you’ve loved for 31 years is missing you," she noted, per A Life.</p><img alt="Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward attend Newman's Own George Awards n May 19, 1999 at U.S. Customs House in New York City." title="Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward attend Newman's Own George Awards n May 19, 1999 at U.S. Customs House in New York City." width=3000 height=2211 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-156186688.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Newman and Woodward attend Newman's Own George Awards on May 19, 1999, at the U.S. Customs House in New York City.; Getty Images / Ron Galella, Ltd. / Contributor</span></p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The couple continued making joint projects into their golden years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMLMWpSHdZE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2002 Today interview" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">2002 Today interview</a>, Woodward mentioned that someone once asked her what their relationship was based on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"And I said he's very good looking and very sexy and all of those things," she recalled, "and what finally is left is if you can make somebody laugh."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"And I keep her laughing," Newman interjected.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They also kept the flame alive through their joint passion for the craft that first brought them together. Prominently involved with the local Westport Country Playhouse, they revived a production of Our Town that leveraged its sold-out showings to a run on Broadway during the winter of 2002-03. They later joined up on the Playhouse stage to read love poems for a 2007 Valentine's Day performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following January, three days after Newman marked his 83rd birthday, the husband and wife celebrated their golden anniversary. It was a quiet affair for the aging couple, with Newman battling lung cancer and Woodward adjusting to the real-life onset of Alzheimer's, but a memorable one all the same. "I feel privileged to love that woman,” he told a small gathering of their children and friends. "That I am married to her is the joy of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Newman finally exited, stage left, nine months later, unable to help his wife to the finish line of her own health battles. While not quite the happy ending they–and fans–hoped for, they nevertheless left behind the story of a marriage, with all its glories and imperfections, that was every bit as monumental as their respective careers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmiokaq5brrEsKSapl2fvKK6zZ5ksKefmcSivsNmn6iknK7EsLvDZp6opJSau26vzq6npZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lucy-irving-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-116929-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lucy Irving Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fernando-cruz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fernando Cruz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
