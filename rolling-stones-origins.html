Soon, the three were regularly getting together to listen to records and explore their own budding talents, teaming with two others to form Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys.<br></p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read His Biography</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The band’s name was inspired by a Muddy Waters track</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 1962, Jagger and Richards ventured to the Ealing Club in London to check out a set by Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated. The band’s jazz-influenced drummer, Charlie Watts, was sure-handed, but the 19-year-olds were particularly taken with slide guitar work of Brian Jones—then performing under the name “Elmo Lewis,” after his blues hero Elmore James.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jagger and Richards began performing with Blues Incorporated, but Jones, determined to forge his own blues-based act, soon pried them away for his fledgling band. They were joined by Taylor, and an ad placed in Jazz News brought in a keyboardist named Ian Stewart.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That summer, when Korner pulled Blues Incorporated out of their regular gig at London’s Marquee Club due to a scheduling conflict, he suggested Jones, Jagger, and the rest as replacements. Their group still without a name, Jones drew inspiration from a Muddy Waters track titled “Rollin’ Stone,” and the rest is history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On July 12, 1962, the band debuted as the Rolling Stones, with Jagger as lead singer, Richards and Jones on guitar, Taylor on bass, Stewart on keyboards and Mick Avory—later of The Kinks—on drums.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Tough times gave way to the key additions of Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts</h2><img alt="brian jones, bill wyman, mick jagger, and keith richards of the rolling stones on stage in front of a brick wall that says rolling stones" title="Rolling Stones performing circa 1964" width=5144 height=3005 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thank-your-lucky-stars-tv-pop-music-show-1964-from-left-to-right-brian-jones-bill-wyman-mick-jagger-and-keith-richards-photo-by-terry-oneill_iconic-images_getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones circa 1964</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although the Marquee owner invited the Rolling Stones back for regular gigs, the months ahead would be trying ones for the band’s members. Jagger, Richards, and Jones found a place together in the Chelsea section of London, living in squalor as they stretched the leftover money from Jagger’s scholarship between the three of them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In December, after Taylor threw in the towel and returned to art school, The Stones gave a tryout to bassist Bill Wyman of The Cliftons. A few years older than the others and less familiar with their R&B influences, Wyman nevertheless played well enough to earn approval, helping his cause by donating his amplifiers to the under-equipped band.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Early in the new year, another important piece was secured when Watts stepped in to give the group a reliable drummer. On January 14, 1963, the now recognizable early lineup of the Rolling Stones—Jagger, Richards, Jones, Watts, Wyman, and Stewart—played in public for the first time at the Flamingo Club in Soho.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">A residency at the Crawdaddy Club paved the way for management and record deals</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The band got their next boost from Soviet-born promoter Giorgio Gomelsky, who booked The Stones for a residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London, beginning in February 1963. It was here that the group developed its first significant following, with students from the area pouring in to see this energetic R&B band and its whirling frontman. Local newspapers caught on to the act, with another budding group of rock royalty, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/how-the-beatles-formed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Beatles" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Beatles</a>, even dropping by to see what the fuss was about.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late April, 19-year-old promoter Andrew Loog Oldham caught wind of the sensation. Convinced the group’s combination of sound and sex appeal would catch fire—and with Gomelsky out of the country—he quickly moved in with his partner, Eric Easton, and signed The Stones to a management contract. By mid-May, a deal with Decca Records was in place as well.</p><img alt="mick jagger whips something around his head while standing on a stage with drumsets and two other men, a crowd of people stands in the background" title="Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones in concert, 1969" width=3001 height=2046 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rolling-stones-msg-1969-1969-in-new-york-city-new-york-photo-by-michael-ochs-archives_getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones in concert in 1969</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with Gomelsky, the heavyset Stewart came out on the short end of the talks, as he was dropped from live performances (though he was allowed to remain as a session musician and road manager). It was part of the driving management style of Oldham, who urged the band to think big and quit their day jobs once and for all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On June 7, 1963, the Stones released their debut single, a cover of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/chuck-berry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chuck Berry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chuck Berry</a>’s “Come On.” With their own acclaimed compositions soon to come, as well as lineup changes that would see the tragic departure of Jones but never the tandem of Jagger-Richards, The Stones were on their way to setting the rock ’n’ roll standard with their string of unforgettable hits and staggering longevity.<strong></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sixty years later, the Rolling Stones have released dozens of hit songs, with eight <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/how-many-number-ones-do-the-rolling-stones-have/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reaching No. 1" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reaching No. 1</a> in the charts.
