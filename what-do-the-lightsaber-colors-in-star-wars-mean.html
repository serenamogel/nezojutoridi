What started out as a limited palette of laser weapons has over time evolved into a myriad of colors and sci-fi styles in the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a></strong> universe that live up to the descriptor, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An elegant weapon for a more civilized age</a>.”</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>If the supercut above proves anything, it’s that lightsabers are indisputably awesome, even if the colors we’ve seen them take on the silver screen are rather limited. There are the classics, of course ⏤ blue, green, and red ⏤ as well as some of the newer additions, including purple, yellow, black, and white.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Each lightsaber color has a distinct symbolic significance for the Force user wielding it, and some are more obvious than others. Without further ado, let’s combine Star Wars canon with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends</a> and take a look at a few lightsaber colors to decipher what they really mean.&nbsp;First we’ll look at the lightsabers within the Star Wars canon.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Blue</h3><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Here it is, old faithful. Blue is the first lightsaber blade to ignite the silver screen ⏤ a moment, and color, that changed our lives forever. Blue is generally is associated with calm, trust, and stability, as is the Jedi who uses the Force and saber technique on a physical level. Notable blue lightsaber owners are Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Rey Skywalker. Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> video of actor Ewan McGregor choosing Obi-Wan’s lightsaber.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Green</h3><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Next in line is green. When Luke makes his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entrance</a> in Return of the Jedi, he shows off his new green lightsaber and blows our collective minds. Green sabers find themselves in the hands of Jedi who are a little more philosophical and diplomatic ⏤ Jedi like Yoda, Qui-Gon Jinn, or Luke Skywalker. Green lightsaber wielders reflect on the depths of their own struggles, both the good and the bad.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Red</h3><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Red equals evil, which everyone likely knows by now. Unlike the Jedi, Sith lightsabers seem to run on a more one-size-fits-all model. Red is the color of passion, hate, power, and anger. Basically all the emotions you might feel while stuck in traffic, among other unenjoyable situations.&nbsp;The most recognizable red lightsaber owners are Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Kylo Ren, and Asajj Ventress. If you don’t know who the latter is, get to know her in the video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><h3 data-injectable=false>Purple</h3><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Out with the old and in with the new! Purple was the first delineation in saber colors seen within the Star Wars universe. Purple is a color of royalty, respect, and calm under pressure. It’s no surprise, then, that the only Jedi (in the current canon, anyway) to wield a purple lightsaber is Mace Windu. Windu was a Jedi in tune with both his light and dark sides.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>The more literal explanation for Windu’s purple saber comes by way of actor Samuel L. Jackson. Basically, he wanted to stand out and asked George Lucas for a purple lightsaber. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This </a>interaction proves it, and the interview below sheds a little more light on a Jedi who may have the most swagger the galaxy far, far away has ever seen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true></figure><h3 data-injectable=false>Yellow&nbsp;</h3><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Out of truly unknown waters comes the yellow lightsaber. Recently, we saw Rey Skywalker ignite her yellow blade at the end of The Rise Of Skywalker, but there have been a few more Force users to rock the ambiguous color. Yellow is the color of harmony, and the Jedi who used them most were the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Temple Guards</a>, signaling complete detachment and a monk-like lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>White</h3><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>White is one of the rarest lightsaber colors in existence and is used by Force users who have given up the path of the Jedi. Forging their own trails, white lightsaber holders choose to neither become Jedi nor Sith and instead create a style unique to themselves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/uE16byoX3dA</figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>The only white lightsaber wielder we know of is Anakin Skywalker’s old apprentice, Ahsoka Tano. Cast out of the Jedi order for a crime she didn’t commit, Ahsoka became disillusioned with the Jedi way and set out on her own. White represents purity, neutrality, and positivity.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Black</h3><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Last but not least are the black sabers ⏤ more specifically, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Darksaber</a>. Created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian Jedi, the Darksaber was passed down generation to generation by Vizsla’s progeny. It holds massive cultural significance in that whoever possesses the Darksaber can lay claim to the throne of Mandalore and lead its people.&nbsp;Black represents mystery, absence, and instability. It’s hardcore.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Now let’s go beyond what’s accepted and look at some of the more eccentric lightsaber colors seen in Star Wars Legends.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Indigo</h3><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Indigo’s tough. It’s somewhere between blue and purple and can be difficult to distinguish, but it certainly looks cool. The only known indigo lightsaber wielder is rogue Jedi Knight Cal Kestis. Indigo represents wisdom and spirituality, and Cal has both in spades.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Bronze</h3><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>There’s a bronze lightsaber? Yes, and it’s fantastic. Owned by none other than Lowabacca, the Force-sensitive nephew of Chewbacca, bronze is the color of earth, nature, and life. Aside from brown (yes, those exist too), bronze may be the rarest lightsaber color of all.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Magenta</h3><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Lighter than red, more pink than purple, magenta lightsabers are hard to come by. Magenta represents charm, compassion, and femininity. These traits bode well for the only known magenta lightsaber user, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mara Jade</a>, the woman who served as Emperor Palpatine’s assassin and who would later fall in love with Luke Skywalker, becoming a Jedi herself.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>Their love story is Shakespearean in scope, so take a look at the video below for a romantic Mara-Luke crash course.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>There you have it, the spectrum of colors that makes up one of the most recognizable weapons in science fiction history. For a more in-depth analysis of lightsabers and their colors, watch the video essay below to educate yourself in the ways of the Jedi.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Don’t forget the types of lightsabers, either. (You thought this presentation was over? Oh, young Padawan.) There’s the standard, double-bladed, curved, hilted ⏤ the list goes on and on. No really, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s</a> a list of lightsaber types. Lightsabers aren’t just for the battleground, they’re for the runway. Or at least, with this many options, they should be.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>If you’d like to discover which lightsaber color might reflect your inner Jedi (or Sith), here’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quiz</a> you can take. Padawans used to have to go all the way to the planet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ilum</a> to figure this kind of thing out, but now, do it from the comfort of your laptop, you can.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGKxsHnToZxmpJmctbW%2FwJucq2WTpLmwvtJmoKdlo6mus3nWmqmsZZ2arq97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristine-zell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>who is TV Personality Kristine Zell?
