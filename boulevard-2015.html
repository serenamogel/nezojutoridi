The catalyst for Nolan's choice is his father's cardiac arrest. After leaving the hospital, Nolan drives down a shadier street of town, and picks up a young male prostitute named Leo (<a href=#>Roberto Aguire</a>). They go to a motel, but Nolan isn't paying for anything sexual; he just wants to talk, to interact with someone that might listen.</p><p>The two continue to see each other, of which Nolan is insistent upon paying for his time. Nolan isn’t clear about his intentions, which alarms Leo, but he isn’t malicious about them. Talking to Leo makes Nolan happy, as does the idea of taking care of him. Nolan wants a true connection with a human being. As Nolan spends more time sneaking out to see Leo, the charade of his public life begins to unravel.</p><p><span>Williams and director <a href=#>Dito Montiel</a> are in tune with a pervading sense of tenderness, as the movie distinctly ruminates on connection, not love. Writer <a href=#>Douglas Soesbe</a> does something that's nothing short of miraculous with the presentation of its secret, by stripping it of its sensationalism, and showing how big a deal it is despite the smallness of Nolan's character. The dialogue within Nolan's moments of accepting himself provides for revelatory scenes, especially the spacious conversation between him and his wife, as she expresses her awareness of the situation, but her own resistance to see it change. Montiel's usual dramatic instincts, to go big and brash, are aptly muffled for the most part, except for the couple moments of false intensity involving Leo's abusive pimp Eddie (<a href=#>Giles Matthey</a>).</span></p><p>With dramatic scripts, Williams was a hushed force that offered something painfully human, and a talent who would go to the darkest depths with directors who had the right story (ex. <a href=#>Bobcat Goldthwait</a>’s "<a href=#>World's Greatest Dad</a>," the definitive Williams role in the 2000s). The ingredient he brings most to "Boulevard" is heartfelt empathy, which makes this portrayal heroic. In such a peaceful performance, Williams achieves layers with muted expressions of angst or defeat, and a confident stillness. In his everyman presence, which he achieves before even stepping into the movie's generic suburban setting, Williams is as gentle as he is compassionate for those who live with their secrets daily. Just like with his rambunctious comedy, he plays this character as an accomplished entertainer with nothing to lose.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bpq6klauus7CMa2dqbQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keleigh-teller-ethnicity-what-is-keleigh-tellers-ethnicity-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keleigh Teller Ethnicity | What is Keleigh Tellers Ethnicity?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pokemon-snacks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pokmon as Snacks: Can You Eat Em All?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
