On January 13, he asked out the 'Wednesday' actress <a href=# rel>Jenna Ortega</a>, 20, for a 'nice dinner'. Netizens were quick to respond to the YouTuber's bold gesture. While some of them trolled him, asking why the actress would accept since she doesn't know him, others took this opportunity to showcase their humorous side and a few even tweeted in his support asking Ortega to give him a chance.</p><p>Originally an ‘NBA 2K’ content creator, Ross found widespread fame in 2021 and became one of Twitch’s biggest streamers. He has been banned from <a href=#>Twitch</a> on several occassions. On April 20, 2022, Ross was banned indefinitely due to the use of "hateful slurs or symbols". The reasoning behind this decision was the accusation through video evidence that Ross used a homophobic slur on Twitch streamer YourRAGE's livestream. He was able to later resume streaming in June 2022.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>Did Kanye West tease his marriage in a song?
