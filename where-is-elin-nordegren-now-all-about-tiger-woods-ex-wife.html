So, where is the ever-elusive Elin Nordegren now, over a decade since her high-profile split?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-elin-nordegren-before-and-during-tiger-woods data-injectable=false>Elin Nordegren before and during Tiger Woods</h2><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Elin Nordegren was born on 1 January 1980 in Stockholm, Sweden. She had a strong interest in modeling as a child and pursued a career in the profession. Her good looks and natural charisma drew the attention of various modeling agencies, leading to successful modeling gigs in Sweden and the United States. Elin also attended Rollins College in Florida after graduating from high school, majoring in psychology.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>It was during her time at college that fate intertwined her path with none other than Tiger Woods — the two first crossed paths in 2001 at the British Open. At this time, Elin was working as a nanny for Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who introduced her to Woods. The sparks between the two were immediate, and soon became an item. When Elin’s gorgeous appearance collided with Woods’ unmatched athletic triumphs, they were instantly thrust into the spotlight as one of the ultimate power couple of the early 2000s.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Their romance bloomed swiftly, and Woods proposed at a South African game reserve in 2003. They married the following year, in 2004, in a splendid ceremony in Barbados. The wedding was attended by intimate friends, family, and celebrities. The couple grew their family over time, welcoming their daughter, Sam Alexis, in 2007 and son, Charlie Axel, in 2009. On the surface, they appeared to be the ideal family.</p><h2 id=h-the-cheating-scandal-and-subsequent-divorce data-injectable=false>The cheating scandal and subsequent divorce&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Elin Nordegren’s marriage to Tiger Woods seemed like a fairytale, with many fans believing in happily ever afters. Being the ultimate power couple, they were perpetually under the relentless gaze of the ever-curious public. Elin was the perfect wife and ultimate cheerleader for Tiger’s golfing conquests, as he reigned supreme in the sport. Their life together seemed straight out of a glossy magazine cover.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>However, in November 2009, the mighty façade started to show signs of wear and tear when a tabloid reported an alleged affair between Woods and a nightclub hostess. The media whirlwind that ensued included numerous women who said they had affairs with the golfer. When Woods was involved in a bizarre car accident near his Florida home, rumors about the health of his marriage reached a fever pitch. Facing mounting pressure, Woods publicly admitted to infidelity and took a break from professional golf. He also underwent therapy for issues related to his behavior. Despite attempts to reconcile, the damage to their marriage was irreversible.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>In August 2010, the couple officially divorced, ending what had once been one of the most admired unions in the world of sports. While the end of their marriage was filled with controversy and drama, both parties have since moved on. They co-parent their children, prioritizing their well-being and maintaining a cordial relationship for their sake.</p><h2 id=h-life-after-the-marriage-and-scandals data-injectable=false>Life after the marriage and scandals</h2><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>The news of Tiger Woods’ extramarital affair changed Elin Nordegren’s life. The media scandal was one of the most discussed topics of the decade. Elin, who had previously been reserved, found herself constantly on the covers of gossip magazines. Nonetheless, according to reports, Elin received a considerable financial settlement in the divorce, making it one of the largest in history. Following the widely publicized breakup, Elin pursued a private life, avoiding the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>She prioritized her family’s stability and her own recovery as she began to pick up the pieces of her life. She attended Rollins University in Winter Park, Florida, because she valued education and development. She completed her Bachelor of Science in Psychology in 2014 and was recognized as an Outstanding Senior. Elin Nordegren’s commitment to philanthropy and volunteerism is one constant in her life. She has helped other people by using her influence and wealth.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Elin co-founded the Tiger Woods Foundation, which provides educational opportunities to marginalized youth. She has worked with the foundation to build learning centers and scholarship programs, allowing young people to receive an excellent education and fulfill their full potential.</p><h2 id=h-new-relationships-and-family-growth data-injectable=false>New relationships and family growth</h2><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Even though Elin’s romance with Tiger took a detour into the rough, she didn’t let that swing her away from love. In 2013, she began dating billionaire coal magnate Chris Cline. Although their relationship had ups and downs, they were together for several years before reportedly parting ways for good in 2017.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Elin’s heart soon found another connection, this time with former NFL player Jordan Cameron, and in 2019, the couple welcomed a son. In December 2022, Elin Nordegren gave birth to her fourth child, a son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnmSiq12auaq6jKemq5yVnL%2BmuoynprBlkaG5bq3BqKytZaSetKa%2BjLCmqJyjYrK5edainZ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moriah-elizabeth-net-worth-age-wiki-biography-relationship-wife-dating-ethnicity-height-facts-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Moriah Elizabeth Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Biography, Relationship, Wife, Dating, Ethnicity, Height &amp;amp; Fa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cindy-klunk-obituary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tragedy happens!
