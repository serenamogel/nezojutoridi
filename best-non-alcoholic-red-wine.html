It seems like it wasn’t all that long ago when people who don’t drink alcohol but still love wine were stuck sipping sparkling grape juice with their nice steak dinners. That’s not the case anymore. We’re a little spoiled here in Los Angeles, what with our boutique-y non-alcoholic bottle shops, but even chain liquor stores and grocery stores have started to stock decent dealcoholized wines. The best non-alcoholic red wine still might not be as accessible as the regular kind, but progress is definitely being made. For this taste test, we sourced bottles you’re likely to find at your local big-box booze store, as well as some you’ll have to go online to find.&nbsp;</p><p>When I sat down at my desk with a bunch of bottles of non-alcoholic red wine, I didn’t really know what to expect. Personally, I find most <a href=#>non-alcoholic beers</a> to be dead ringers for their alcoholic counterparts. But I’ve also sampled plenty of non-alcoholic spirits (like <a href=#>non-alcoholic whiskey</a>), and they definitely tend to lack some bite without those intoxicating fermented sugars. I’d say non-alcoholic red wines land somewhere in the middle: They’re not quite as convincing as N/A beer, but they’re definitely better than N/A liquor. Many manage to be tannic but strike an almost vinegary note. But, if you step into the world of non-alcoholic wines with the right expectations, there are some pretty pleasant-tasting options out there.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

It smells almost like berry candy, but not in a bad way. And the taste? I got tropical fruit and bubble gum, but, again, not in a bad way—trust me. If you like a sweet red, like a Schiava or late-harvest Zinfandel, this might actually be the best non-alcoholic red wine for you. It’s very floral, but still a little oaky, and its intricacies came alive the more I sipped and let it sit on my palate. This would be great for people who were casual wine drinkers before they kicked booze, but maybe not wine aficionados.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Total Wine</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best non alcoholic red wine" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_NON_ALCOHOLIC_RED_WINE_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Expensive</p><strong>Null Solo Garnacha</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Studio Null</a><p>This is a pricey N/A wine ($34 a bottle), but it’s just so lovely. It’s a bottle of wine that’s a work of art, from the label to what’s inside. It has a very complex nose—dark and almost charcoal-y, tannic and tangy. The taste is very earthy, almost mushroomy, but it’s not heavy at all. In terms of body, it’s light and smooth. Ultimately, this has less flavor than some of the other de-alcoholized wines we tasted—even some of cheaper ones—and it’s also a little bitter. But I still highly recommend seeking this out for romantic evenings in.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Studio Null</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best non alcoholic red wine" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_NON_ALCOHOLIC_RED_WINE_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Accessible (Top Pick)</p><strong>Be Well Cabernet Sauvignon</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine</a><p>At about 15 bucks a bottle, Be Well Cabernet is affordable, accessible, and it tastes like wine. Not necessarily great wine, but good wine. It has a little bit of wine tang, but also some earthiness I enjoyed. The brand’s website references its notes of black plum and dark cherry, and hints of cocoa powder and black pepper. That all sounds like it would add up to a big, bold flavor, but I think this N/A wine’s greatest strength is how neutral and pleasant it is. It also has a smooth, light mouthfeel (I would have pegged it as a Pinot, myself). As I wrote in my notes, “I’d drink this with steak and be very happy about it.”&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Total Wine</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best non alcoholic red wine" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_NON_ALCOHOLIC_RED_WINE_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Sovi Reserve Red</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Sovi</a><p>“That’s the stuff,” is what I wrote in my notes when I tasted Sovi Reserve Red. This de-alcoholized Cabernet Sauvignon-Petite Sirah blend made with grapes grown in California just feels well crafted. It’s tannic and oaky (in fact, it was aged in both French and American oak barrels, so there ya go), but still smooth and light bodied. To me, this has a deep cherry flavor that lingers on the back of your tongue, but the bottle touts notes of plum and boysenberry (it’s stonefruit-forward, so I was on to something). This is an impressive N/A red and at $38 a bottle, it’s one you’ll probably reserve for dinner parties thrown by people you actually care about impressing. Or, what the hell. Just treat yourself.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Sovi</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried: </strong>Radiant Red Almost Zero Van Loveren Family Vineyards, Fre Merlot, St. Regis Cabernet Sauvignon&nbsp;</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite non-alcoholic red wine with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuus6nZJqkk6S1sLjInGSrnZRixKq6xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vivienne-westwood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vivienne Westwood - Clothes, Career &amp;amp; Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-you-star-penn-badgley.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heres Everything You Need To Know About You Star Penn Badgley</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
