Her parents, Edward and Natalie, supported Ortega’s dream of becoming an actor, though they “have no interest whatsoever in [Hollywood] or in the film industry,” Ortega <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_ZbF0GRNo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in an Elle interview" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said in an Elle interview</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, Ortega is grateful for the support she receives from her family saying, “they sacrificed a lot for me to do what I do.” Before she became famous, Ortega’s mom would drive her from their family home in California’s Coachella Valley to Los Angeles for auditions, a trip that would take hours of driving each way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Natalie is an emergency room nurse, and Edward works in the California district attorney’s office.

Her onscreen success wasn’t always the case, however, and Ortega has been vocal about having a hard time landing roles at times because she felt that casting directors didn’t think she had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jenna-Ortega data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“the look they were going for.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“the look they were going for.”</a> Still, Ortega’s dedication to acting paid off as she began landing bigger and bigger roles in the mainstream media.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ortega’s largest role to date is as the lead in Netflix’s Wednesday, in which she portrays the iconic Wednesday Addams in a modern, live-action take on the beloved The Addams Family series. Ortega’s portrayal of the titular character earned her Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations as well as an award for Best Performance in a Show at the 2023 MTV Movie and TV Awards. Other Hollywood heavyweights appeared alongside Ortega in Wednesday including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/catherine-zeta-jones data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Catherine Zeta-Jones" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, Luis Guzmán, and Ortega’s beloved offscreen friend Gwendoline Christie.

Ortega’s role in this movie—especially after her parts in other horror flicks like Insidious: Chapter 2 and the gore-filled X, which came out on the heels of 2022’s Scream—began to cement her status as a slasher film mainstay. Scream VI was released in March 2023 and saw Ortega reprise the role of final girl Tara Carpenter.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Wednesday</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ortega stars in the Netflix hit series Wednesday, <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">which was the most watched premiere of 2022</a>. Ortega’s nuanced performance as Wednesday Addams was widely praised and helped secure a second season.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the show, Ortega is enrolled at a school full of paranormal (and paranormal-adjacent) students after being kicked out of a regular public school because she intentionally maimed the swim team. Once Wednesday’s settled into her new digs–which she hates–she finds herself at the center of several mysteries and resolves to discover the truth. Ortega was hands-on with this character, <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">making changes to scripts</a> and even choreographing the much-loved <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">dance sequence</a> seen in the first season’s fourth episode.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 20 years old, Ortega has also made waves with Wednesday on account of her <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">2023 Emmy nomination</a> for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy. <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, this makes her the second youngest leading actress nominee in a comedic role after Patty Duke’s 1964 nomination at age 18<br></p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Beetlejuice 2</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nearly four decades after directing the cult-classic Beetlejuice, <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tim Burton</a> is getting behind the camera to direct the film’s sequel, Beetlejuice 2.
