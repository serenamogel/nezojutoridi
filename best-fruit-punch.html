Throughout my childhood, anyway, it was the beverage of choice at classroom pizza parties and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">birthday celebrations</a>. It usually came in a big gallon milk jug, was sugary as hell, and was so violently red, it tended to leave kids running around for the rest of the day with gross little red mustaches. But the best fruit punch at the grocery store isn’t necessarily the kind that will permanently stain your mouth and face—although there’s a place for that stuff, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, fruit punch should taste like fruit—cherries and pineapples are major players. But because many of us have been conditioned to enjoy the super-saccharine artificial flavor of the fruit punches of our childhoods, actual fruit juice content doesn’t necessarily make one fruit punch better than others. In fact, the best fruit punch brand on this list is only 15% real fruit juice. Now, grab a little paper cup, go post up by the jungle gym (where the cool kids hang), and take a big swig of the best fruit punch.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Seriously, as a single twenty-something, I used to drink as much juice as a family of four (and then wonder why I had to urgently poop all the time). Anyway, when I was in the throes of my addiction, Juicy Juice was a go-to. This is the only fruit punch we tried in our taste test that is 100% fruit juice. It’s a more subdued shade of red than many fruit punches (the color in the product image is not accurate) and tastes more like various fruit purees than a tangy amalgamation of artificial fruit flavors. Does that make it less fun? I mean, a little. But it’s the best fruit punch if you want fruit juice and nothing but fruit juice.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit punch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_FRUIT_PUNCH_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Berry</p><strong>Minute Maid Berry Punch</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>We tried a few Minute Maid fruit punches—in addition to berry, we tried Fruit Punch, Tropical Punch, and Zero Sugar Fruit Punch—and none of them were outstanding, but this one makes the list for being such a pleasant deviation from the cherry-forward punches you’re accustomed to. It has a bright strawberry flavor that goes nicely with the rest of the juice blend (pear and grape juices). It’s super sweet, but not in a gross way. It’s the best fruit punch if you have fruit punch fatigue.</p><p>Credit: Merc / TK</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit punch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_FRUIT_PUNCH_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Childhood Classic</p><strong>Hi-C Flashin’ Fruit Punch</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Hi-C fruit punch is a childhood classic. This is the stuff that absolutely would stain your upper lip, but luckily for adults with some semblance of self-consciousness, it comes in a box with a little sippy straw for minimal juice-to-lip contact. If you’ve continued drinking fruit punch into adulthood, you’ve probably come across this one a lot (at fountain drink stations, etc.) and, I have to say, it totally holds up. It’s tart, sweet, and delicious. I couldn’t isolate individual flavors, but that’s part of what makes it great—it’s a punch to its core. I tasted this alongside Fruit Juicy Red Hawaiian Punch and it’s significantly better tasting. (I was sure my adult palate would still love Hawaiian Punch, but it’s pretty bad!) Hi-C is only 3% percent fruit juice, but it’s the best fruit punch&nbsp;if you want a sip of nostalgia.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruit punch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BEST_FRUIT_PUNCH_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Simply Fruit Punch</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>When we sit down to taste juices here at Sporked, Simply is a frequent frontrunner (check out our rankings of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best orange juice</a>, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best apple juice</a>, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best lemonade</a> for proof). And, sure enough, Simply makes the best fruit punch we tried during this taste test. This punch is cherry forward, and I like that. You know how the labels on fruit punch bottles usually show a slew of fruits splishing around in water or bursting with juice themselves? Simply’s label has a still life that simply features a pineapple slice, some cherries, and a few cranberries. And, true to the label, the ingredients are pineapple, cherry, and cranberry juices (along with some lemon juice for tartness). Pineapple, cherry, and cranberry together make a really nice, simple mix. This is 15% juice, but that works for it. This is a perfect punch—slap me if I’m wrong!&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried: </strong>Minute Maid Fruit Punch, Minute Maid Tropical Punch, Minute Maid Zero Sugar Fruit Punch, Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red, Tropicana Island Punch, Tropicana Pineapple Mango Splash</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite fruit punch with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFustGuoK1loKq7pLSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-cut-cupcake-wrappers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to cut cupcake wrappers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-truong-giang-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Truong Giang? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship,Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
