Following in the footsteps of Greg O’Shea, Maura Higgins, Yewande Biala, Matthew MacNabb, Rob Lipsett, Kaila Troy, and Shannen Reilly McGrath who appeared in the previous series.</p><p>Speaking in his introductory video, Dami said: ‘I have this gift or something. I have this birthmark-shaped heart on my penis. ‘Usually, when I tell a girl I have that, they don’t believe me and then I show them. I call it my love stick’.</p><p>Although Dami kept quiet about what qualities he was looking for in a partner, he confessed that he’s a catch. When it comes to his type on paper, Dami may not have one, as he explained his dating history is “very diverse.” He said: “I’ve dated different people from different cultures. I’m very open-minded about it.”</p><p>Dami further explained, “When I’m actually in a relationship, I think it’s a star sign thing, I’m an Aries but I’m very passionate – I always used to put that person first”.</p><p>He continued: “If they had something they wanted to do or something they were passionate about, I’d make sure that even if it’s something I’m not talented at I’d get talented at it just so it helps them. I’m really good at being in a team and actually looking after each other.”</p><p>Below you’ll learn about his real name, his parents, his height, and his job as a microbiologist.</p><h3><strong>Dami Hope On Love Island 2022</strong></h3><p>Dami Hope is proud of his charming persona.

He added, “Love Island is a different experience, I will be talking to different girls, it might not go well with some, might go well with others, so it’s a fun experience”.</p><p>Dami assured the outlet that he was bringing “Just myself – Dami Hope! Being me – funny and my personality.
