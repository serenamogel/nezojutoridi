Featuring popular British actors like Toby Jones and David Morrissey, the series gives a dramatized portrayal of the arduous investigation behind Sutcliffe’s capture and the effects his heinous crimes had on survivors and his victims’ families.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Who Was Peter Sutcliffe?" data-anchor-id=who-was-peter-sutcliffe class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Who Was Peter Sutcliffe?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, known as the Yorkshire Ripper, killed at least 13 women and brutally assaulted seven others between 1975 and 1980. His earliest known attack was in 1969; that victim survived and didn’t press charges. Terror spread through northern England as Sutcliffe’s attacks continued, spurring a years-long manhunt that involved an estimated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/peter-sutcliffe-yorkshire-ripper-story-police-mistakes-b69345.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2.5 million police hours" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">2.5 million police hours</a>. The investigation was riddled with problems, including disrespect for Sutcliffe’s victims who were sex workers and a hoax that misdirected police. Sutcliffe was finally arrested and convicted in 1981. The Yorkshire Ripper has attracted continued interest over the years, with his story being told in a true-crime podcast and in the 2020 Netflix documentary <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/title/81006684 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Ripper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Ripper</a>.

His parents were John and Kathleen Sutcliffe. Peter grew up with five younger siblings, two brothers and three sisters, in a working-class Catholic family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a teenager, he was said to be a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/who-yorkshire-ripper-peter-sutcliffe-8616762 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="loner with voyeuristic tendencies" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">loner with voyeuristic tendencies</a>. He left school in 1961, when he was 15, and afterward took on several different jobs, including at a factory and a mill. He became a grave digger in 1964, which led to a part-time job at a local morgue. He bragged to friends about robbing bodies at the morgue.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1976, Sutcliffe found a job as a truck driver. He became a trusted employee and remained in the position during his killing spree.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title=Victims data-anchor-id=victims class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Victims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beginning in the late 1960s, Sutcliffe was responsible for targeting at least 21 victims, 13 of whom he killed. Eight people survived his gruesome attacks with lasting trauma and severe injuries. He exclusively sought out women, usually sex workers, in Yorkshire and Manchester. Sutcliffe often battered his victims with a hammer, as well as stabbed and mutilated them with a knife or sharpened screwdriver. The bulk of his crimes occurred between 1975 and 1980. However, authorities have said Sutcliffe could be responsible for additional crimes and have investigated whether he is connected to unsolved cases.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sutcliffe committed his first known attack in 1969. He used a sock with a stone in it to strike a woman. She survived but declined to press charges. Several years passed before he acted again.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first woman Sutcliffe is known to have killed was 28-year-old Wilma McCann. She was a sex worker who he murdered in October 1975, and Sutcliffe later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/health-europe-coronavirus-pandemic-3a23efe53a46858ac44803dd2ca0b1eb data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=confessed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">confessed</a> to the police, “After that first time, I developed and played up a hatred for prostitutes in order to justify within myself a reason why I had attacked and killed Wilma McCann.” He killed another sex worker, 42-year-old Emily Jackson, in January 1976.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, Sutcliffe took the lives of four women: 28-year-old Irene Richardson in February, 32-year-old Patricia Atkinson in April, 16-year-old Jayne MacDonald in June, and 21-year-old Jean Jordan in October. Unlike his previous victims, MacDonald hadn’t engaged in sex work. This change in victim profile resulted in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6173755.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="national press attention" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">national press attention</a>, and soon, the media was using the name the “Yorkshire Ripper” to describe the killer.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Another Infamous Ripper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His three victims in 1978 were sex workers Yvonne Pearson, Helen Rytka, and Vera Millward. Sutcliffe killed Pearson, 22, and Rytka, 18, in separate attacks that January. He murdered Millward, 40, in May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sutcliffe waited nearly a year to claim his next victim. In April 1979, he killed Josephine Whittaker, a 19-year-old bank clerk. According to one police detective, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-54894311 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“mass hysteria”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“mass hysteria”</a> ensued because more women felt threatened.

One issue with the investigation was the sheer quantity of information. So many index cards were used that the rooms holding these cards needed reinforced floors. And at the time, there were no computers to process the facts contained on the cards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Investigators missed other opportunities to stop the serial killer. Police interviewed Sutcliffe nine times prior to his arrest. In one encounter, no one spotted that he was wearing a pair of boots that matched a print left at the scene of one of his crimes. Nor did authorities follow up after a friend sent the police an anonymous letter denouncing Sutcliffe. When they traced a five-pound banknote discovered on one victim to Sutcliffe’s employer, police accepted Sutcliffe’s alibi that he had been at a party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1979, police fell for a hoax tape and letters purportedly from the Yorkshire Ripper, a mistake that had deadly consequences. Sutcliffe had a Yorkshire accent, but the accent on the hoax recording led authorities to search for suspects outside of Yorkshire. Police bought into the hoax even as some survivors <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-54874713 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="informed authorities" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">informed authorities</a> that their assailant had spoken with a Yorkshire accent. Sutcliffe killed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-54874713 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="three additional victims" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">three additional victims</a> between the hoax tape investigatory detour and his arrest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Police also dismissed some victims who didn’t fit into their “prostitute killer” profile. This meant that when Marcella Claxton, who wasn’t a sex worker, survived an assault in May 1976, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/health-europe-coronavirus-pandemic-3a23efe53a46858ac44803dd2ca0b1eb data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her testimony" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">her testimony</a> was ignored, along with the accurate sketch she’d helped create.

The last six attacks were on totally respectable women.” Following Sutcliffe’s death in 2020, a police constable <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/uk/peter-sutcliffe-yorkshire-ripper-dead-gbr-intl/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="issued an apology" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">issued an apology</a> “for the additional distress and anxiety caused to all relatives by the language, tone, and terminology used by senior officers at the time in relation to Peter Sutcliffe’s victims.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately, Sutcliffe was arrested in the city of Sheffield on January 2, 1981. He was sitting in a car with a sex worker, Olivia Reivers, when police spotted his fake license plates. After he was taken into custody, police discovered screwdrivers in Sutcliffe’s car, which resulted in a search that uncovered a hammer and knife he stashed near the scene of his arrest. He’d gotten a private moment to do so by telling officers he needed to relieve himself. During his interrogation, Sutcliffe <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/13/yorkshire-ripper-peter-sutcliffe-dies-aged-74 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=confessed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">confessed</a> to the crimes, saying,“It’s all right, I know what you’re leading up to.

Although he’d confessed to being the Yorkshire Ripper after his January arrest, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in court and not guilty to murder, claiming diminished responsibility (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/23/world/briton-is-given-13-life-sentences-for-the-yorkshire-ripper-murders.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="akin to a plea of temporary insanity in the United States" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">akin to a plea of temporary insanity in the United States</a>).

On May 22, 1981, he was found guilty of 13 murders and seven counts of attempted murder. The judge sentenced him to 20 life terms and recommended a minimum sentence of 30 years. The death penalty wasn’t an option, having been abolished in 1965.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After he was captured and behind bars, Sutcliffe began using his mother’s maiden name and going by Peter William Coonan. In 1984, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia saw Sutcliffe removed from prison and sent to Broadmoor Hospital, a secure psychiatric facility. While in custody Sutcliffe applied for the right to parole, but a 2010 ruling said that he would never be released from prison. He was declared mentally able to leave the secure hospital and sent to a maximum-security prison in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sutcliffe experienced numerous assaults while in custody.
