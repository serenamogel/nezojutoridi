This isn’t even the first time he’s taking over a role already made famous by an established star. Here are some of the reasons why Seacrest makes total sense as the new face of Wheel—and is already among the best hosts of his generation.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emevuu60">He’s filled the seats of other legends</h2><img alt="ryan seacrest looking and gesturing off camera while having a conversation with dj casey kasem" title="Ryan Seacrest and Casey Kasem on “America’s Top 40 Live”" width=3000 height=2061 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ryan-seacrest-and-casey-kasem-during-americas-top-40-live-news-photo-1687981753.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Ryan Seacrest interacts with former American Top 40 host Casey Kasem in 2005.

However, Seacrest can already say he’s followed in the path of three additional superstars with his TV and radio roles:</p><ul data-node-id=9 class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li><strong>Casey Kasem</strong>, the popular DJ who began hosting the weekly American Top 40 music countdown in July 1970. Known for his on-air sincerity and authority when it came to music trivia, Kasem, who died in June 2014, hosted the program through 1988 and during another six-year stretch starting in 1998.

They ranged from simply being nice and building a great team to never quitting in the face of adversity. “Dick faced some enormous challenges after his stroke. And despite facing public criticism for fighting through those challenges on-air, he refused to quit what he loved doing most,” Seacrest wrote. “If only more of us remembered the strength and grace generated from sticking to your guns.
