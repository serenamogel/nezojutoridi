For Jack, “it's quite important that he shows her that his commitment is absolute, and what better way to do that than to take those vows and make it forever?” Henderson says.<h2>Does Mel and Jack have a baby in Virgin River Books?</h2>Virgin River enthusiasts will already know Mel and Jack have a son of their own named David in Robyn Carr's series of novels. Even so, showrunner Sue Tenney won't necessarily be sticking to the original story as the television adaptation progresses.<h2>Is Jack Doc and Hope's son?</h2>Though some Virgin River fans were puzzled up until then, this seemed to indicate the Jack isn't Hope's mom.
