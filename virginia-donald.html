She came to the limelight more than her work after marrying American broadcast journalist <strong>Shepard Smith</strong>. Shepard is best known as the managing editor and chief anchor of Fox News Channel from 1996 until <i>October 11, 2019.</i></p><p>Virginia was born in the <i>Mississippi, United States</i>, in <i>1966 </i>to the American Donald parents. She holds American citizenship and belongs to white ethnicity. For her education, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree&nbsp;from the <i>University of Mississippi</i> in <i>1988</i>.</p><h2>Wedded to her College Sweetheart, Shepard Smith</h2><p>This beautiful woman was previously married to her ex-husband, Shepard Smith for about 6-years. Before marriage, they had their first interaction at the University of Mississippi around the 1980s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/Virginia-Donald-2-1280x720-1587019012679.jpg><p>Shephard had a crush on Virginia during the college period and began having an affair. Then, after a few years of dating, the classmates of the colleges agreed to take their love life to the next level and eventually announced their wedding in <i>1987</i>.</p><h2>Got Divorced in 1993</h2><p>Until <i>1993</i>, Virginia and Shepard shared a strong bond but soon created an issue between them. Donald filed for divorce after six years of nuptials, which was settled in 1993.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/1/19/news-1611035042043.JPG><p>However, the actual reasons for their split were not known until <i>2017 </i>when Shepard spoke in a speech about his sexuality. So, several sources say their division's sexual orientation may be the cause. From their marital life, the exes Donald and Shepard&nbsp;had no biological kids.</p><h2>Smith Came Out as a Gay in 2017</h2><p>In <i>2017</i>, Fox News' former host publicly announced&nbsp;that he was gay. Shepard said that he is in a love relationship with a long-time boyfriend named <strong>Giovanni Graziano</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/Giovanni-Graziano-with-Shepher-Smith-634x405-1587018960497.jpg><p>In one of the interviews, Smith declared,</p><p>"<i>I have a longtime boyfriend and we’re as happy as we can be and we live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family. It’s great for us. But I can’t imagine anyone else finding it interesting</i>.''</p><p>The 56 aged Shepard&nbsp;and his other half Giovanni&nbsp;have been enjoying their love life since <i>2012</i>. On the other hand,<strong> </strong>Donald has kept herself and her love life under the radar since the separation from Smith. It seems like Virginia is living a single life.</p><h2>How Much Does Virginia Make?</h2><p>There are no details about her profession in the meantime. In the previous time, Donald used to work as a TV personality and American Socialite. From there, she might have earned a decent amount of money.</p><p>As per some online tabloids, Virginia's net worth is estimated to be <strong>$250,000</strong> as of early 2021, close to another celebrity wife, <a href=#><strong>Wanda Ferraton</strong></a>. &nbsp;Despite the privacy, there is no doubt that Virginia is earning plenty as she likes to splurge on expensive products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/Shep-Smith-Reporting-Fox-News-1587020578199.jpg><p>On the other hand, her former husband, Shephard, has an impressive worth of <strong>$25 million. </strong>He made this fortune from his reporting gigs mainly from FNC's show <i>The Fox Report with Shepard Smith. </i>Another, Fox Host,<i> </i><a href=#><strong>Peter Doocy</strong></a> enjoys a <strong>$2 million </strong>fortune.</p><p>Since <i>July 2020</i>, Smith is working as a broadcast journalist for<i> NBC News</i> and <i>CNBC</i>. There, Shepards hosts the program <i>The News with Shepard Smith</i>. From there, he might be earning an impressive sum of wealth.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For further updates on Celebrities' wife, stay updated with </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2Bgq5%2BZo7aiecOopZqklA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sponge-cola.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sponge Cola Tambay lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-watch-tokyo-revengers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where To Watch Tokyo Revengers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-can-a-man-have-a-baby.html>How old can a man have a baby?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carol-burnett-wiki-height-husband-net-worth.html>Carol Burnett- Wiki, Height, Husband, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./our-mothers-house-1967.html>Our Mother's House movie review (1967)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./intel-ssd-dc-s3700-200gb-review.html>Power Consumption - The Intel SSD DC S3700 (200GB) Review</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sophie-thibault-relationship-married-life-and-kids-2024.html>Sophie Thibault Relationship: Married Life And Kids 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SparkVlog.
